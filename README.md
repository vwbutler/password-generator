# Password Generator

🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐

Knowing that solid passwords protect our precious profiles and personal information, with just a few clicks, the password generator will whip up a random, strong password based on your selections.
The solution walks the user through several prompts when the user clicks the "Generate Password" button.

1. How many password characters would you like to use? Enter a number between 8 and 128.
    - If the user enters a number less than eight or greater than 128, the system reminds the user to enter a number between eight and 128.
2. Do you want to include lowercase letters?
3. Do you want to include uppercase letters?
4. Do you want to include numbers?
5. Do you want to include special characters?

- Suppose the user fails to select any character types listed in 2 - 5. In that case, the system instructs the user to choose at least one of the following types: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, or special characters/symbols.

Here is a mock-up of the user interface.
